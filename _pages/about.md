Hi! I’m a Ph.D. student, born in August 2001 in Ezhou, and currently studying in the [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/) at [Shenzhen University (SZU)](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Qiang Yang](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~qyang/) and [Prof. Weike Pan](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/panwk/index.html). I am currently a visiting student at the [TrustFUL Lab](https://trustful.federated-learning.org/), CCDS, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by [Prof. Han Yu](https://federated-learning.org/han.yu/). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in the [College of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cise.glut.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Guilin University of Technology](https://www.glut.edu.cn/) in 2023. 

My primary research interests include federated learning, transfer learning, recommender systems, deep learning, statistical machine learning, and generative AI. I am open to various kinds of collaborations. If you have any ideas, please feel free to contact me.
